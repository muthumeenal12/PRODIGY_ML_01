# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices. The model utilizes features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms to make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It includes information about various attributes of houses such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and their corresponding prices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muthumeenal12/PRODIGY_ML_01
cd PRODIGY_ML_01
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the linear regression model.

## Files

- `LinearRegression.ipynb`: Colab Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2,739,264,768.05
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 52,337.99
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 35,752.84
- R-squared (R2): 0.6429
